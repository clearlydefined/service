      description: Does the repository support an API to support pulling of information? If not, is the package index organized in a schematized format that can programmatically queried using the package name and version and queried using HTTP(s). When using HTTP to mine data, ClearlyDefined should check for the existence of robots.txt or robot headers that indicate such mining is unacceptable. How much effort is it to automate the process?
