## Change Notification API Calls

The system includes a built-in mechanism to [support notifications for definition changes](https://github.com/clearlydefined/service/issues/958). Changes in definitions, excluding files, and their associated coordinates are published at regular intervals. Every hour, a changeset file is released, listing the coordinates of definitions that have changed during the last hour. Details are documented at "[Publish changes job](https://github.com/clearlydefined/operations/tree/main/tools/blobstorage-backupdata#readme)". You can retrieve these updated definitions (excluding files) using the appropriate API. This document explains how to use the APIs designed to support change notifications.
